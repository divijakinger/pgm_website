            A graph is a structure that comprises a set of vertices and a set of edges. Directed graphical models can be represented by a graph with its vertices serving as random variables and directed edges serving as dependency relationships between them.

                <li>A set V=V(G) whose elements are called vertices, points or nodes of G.</li> 
                <li>A set E = E(G) of an unordered pair of distinct vertices called edges of G.</li>

            The direction of the edges determines the influence of one random variable on another. If the graph does not contain cycles (a number of vertices connected in a closed chain), it is usually referred to as a <b>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</b>. Inference on these graphs may be performed exactly using algorithms such as Belief Propagation (BP) or variable elimination.

        <p class="mt-4">
            A subgraph G of a graph is graph G' whose vertex set and edge set subsets of the graph G. In simple words a graph is said to be a subgraph if it is a part of another graph.
