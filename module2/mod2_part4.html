            Dynamic programming techniques can be used to perform inference even for certain large and complex networks in a very reasonable time.
            <br>
            Considering the inference task in a very simple network
            <br>
            A → B → C → D
            <br>
            We first provide a phased computation, which uses results from the previous phase for the computation in the next phase.
            <br>
            We then reformulate this process in terms of a global computation on the joint distribution.

Considering the inference task in a very simple network A → B →C → D. We first provide a phased computation, which uses results from the previous phase for the computation in the next phase.
We then reformulate this process in terms of a global computation on the joint distribution.
<br>
Assume that our first goal is to compute the probability P(B), that is, the distribution
over values b of B. Basic probabilistic reasoning (with no assumptions) gives

          <img src="./images/img10.png" class="img-fluid"  >
          <br>
          <br>
          Each number P(a) is in the CPD for A, and each number P(b | a) is in the CPD for B.
          If A has k values and B has m values, the number of basic arithmetic operations
          required is O(k x m): to compute P(b), we must multiply P(b | a) with P(a) for each of
          the k values of A, and then add them up, that is, k multiplications and k - 1 additions;
          This process must be repeated for each of the m values b.
          Similarly for C , we have
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="./images/img11.png" class="img-fluid"  >
          <br>
          <br>
          Similarly P(D) can be computed.
          <br>
          Consider the process of generating the entire joint and summing it out, which
          requires that we generate k^n probabilities for the different events x1,..., xn.By the chain rule for Bayesian networks, the joint P(A,B,C,D) decomposes as -
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="./images/img12.png" class="img-fluid"  >
          <br>
          <br>
          To compute P(D), we need to sum together all of the entries where D = d^1 and to (separately) sum together all of the entries where D = d^2. The exact computation that needs to be performed, for binary-valued variables A,B,C,D is
          <br>
          <img src="./images/img13.png" class="img-fluid"  >
          Repeated terms can gain significant computational savings by computing terms once and storing them.
          This procedure is said to be performing dynamic programming.

        <p class="mt-4">
            The key operation performed when computing the probability of some subset of variables is that of marginalizing out variables from a distribution.
            <br>
            Let X be a set of variables, and Y ∉ X a variable. Let φ(X,Y) be a factor.
            <br>
We define the factor marginalization of Y in φ , denoted ΣYφ , to be a factor ψ over X such that:
<br>
ψ(X) = ΣY φ(X,Y)
This operation is also called summing out of Y in ψ.
<br>
The process of marginalizing a joint distribution P(X,Y) onto X in a Markov network is simply summing out the variables Y in the factor corresponding to P.
<br>
We can write,
